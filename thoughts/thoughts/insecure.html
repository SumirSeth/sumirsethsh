            we are never insecure during our childhood phase. i remember seeing photos of me and my friend from age 7~. all were of different heights. now that i try to remember it, my mind doesn't tell me we weren't of the same height. my mind still thinks everything was equal.<br><br>the brain is so different now, comparisons left and right. "why is he taller. why is he short."<br><br>the (social) media isn't helping aswell.<br><br>only hoping life takes me to the peace of childhood.
